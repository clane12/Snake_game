🐍 Snake Game
A simple Snake Game built using Python's Turtle Graphics module. In this game, you control the snake to collect food, which makes the snake longer, while avoiding collisions with the wall or the snake's own body.

✨ Features
🐍 Snake movement controlled by keyboard (W, A, S, D)

🍎 Food randomly spawns, and the snake grows each time it eats food

💯 Keeps track of score and high score

💀 Game-over condition when the snake hits the wall or collides with itself

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x+

Turtle Graphics (comes pre-installed with Python)

🚀 How to Run
Save the script as snake_game.py.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Run the game by typing the following command in your terminal:
python snake_game.py
Use the W, A, S, D keys to control the snake:

W for Up

A for Left

S for Down

D for Right

🎮 How to Play
Objective: The goal is to eat as many pieces of food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

As you eat food, your snake will grow longer, and your score will increase.

When the snake collides with the wall or its tail, the game ends.

🧩 Future Enhancements
🎨 Add different levels with varying difficulty (e.g., faster snake, more obstacles).

🏆 Add a feature to restart the game without closing the program.

🎮 Improve graphics with custom designs for the snake and food.
